    <ul> <!-- start of the list -->
      <li>Understanding the numbers and letters on the end of pencils.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It is called graphite scale. <br/>"B" stands for soft black, "H" stands for hard, "HB" stands for hard black, and "F" stands for firm. <br/>The numbers classify the degrees of the intensity.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Sharpen a pencil</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For a beginner, you can just use a sharpener to start.</li>
          <li>If you want to be more professional, try to use a utility knife. <br/>Hold the pencil with your non-dominant hand and hold the knife with the other hand firmly. Push the blade slowly with your thumb of your non-dominant hand
