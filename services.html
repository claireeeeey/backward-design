    <h1>The first step</h1>
    <p>First, we need to have the posture and action of what you want to draw, either someone or something.</p>
    
    <ul> <!-- start of the list -->
      <li>Capture the outline of the posture and action using simple straight lines.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It may be hard to imagine what it looks like, so it will be easier to use photos or real obkects as reference. <br/>In this step, you don't need to rush to draw the whole figure, we just need the general structure.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Define the form</li>
        <ul>
          <li>For a beginner, you can just use a sharpener to start.</li>
          <li>If you want to be more professional: try to use a utility knife. <br/>Hold the pencil with your non-dominant hand and hold the knife with the other hand firmly. <br/>Push the blade slowly with your thumb of your non-dominant hand and remove the wooden layers of the pencil lightly. <br/>The length of the exposed refills should be round half an inch.</li>
          <li>Be carefull!</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
